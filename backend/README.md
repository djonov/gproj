Backend API for Tasks Projects

### How to start the app

Add "DB_CONNECTION_URL" environment variable to the "env" property in nodemon.json

In the project directory, run "npm run watch-node".

### How to test

npm test

Test will execute against the production database since there is no test database set.
So I highly advise to run the tests after testing the application itself.
