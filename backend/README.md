Backend API for Tasks Projects

### How to start the app

npm start
Add "DB_CONNECTION_URL" environment variable to the "env" property in nodemon.json

### How to test

npm test
Test will execute against the database since there is no test database set. So I highly advise to run the tests after testing the application itself.
